    "## Description \n",
    "Aggregate observations of _Caladenia_ orchids in the ACT so I can analyse the relationship between records and the protection status and vegetation cover of the locations of each species.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of combining suites of spatial variables at different scales across multiple sites to analyse the factors correlated with a variable of interest. Comparable cases could include:\n",
    "- Aggregate spatial data for frost and other extreme weather events associated with chickpeas and wheat yields to analyse the effects of such events on different varieties at different stages and advise growers on the best choices\n",
    "- Aggregate pest data for the same pest across multiple sites and locations to analyse the relationship between population levels and environmental context at the time and over the previous month.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "1. Group orchid species records by species\n",
    "2. Prepare STAC metadata records for each data source (separate records for the distribution data for each orchid species)\n",
    "3. Load data cube\n",
    "4. Mask orchid distribution records to boundaries of ACT\n",
    "5. Calculate the proportion of distribution records for each species occurring inside and outside protected areas\n",
    "6. Calculate the proportion of distribution records for each species occurring in areas with each class of vegetation cover\n",

    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- No attempt is made here to compensate for underlying bias in the areas where observers have spent time recording orchids. The analysis should only be considered indicative of relative tendencies."
