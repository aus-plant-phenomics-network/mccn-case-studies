    "# Case Study 1 - Evaluate impact from environmental events/pressures\n",
    "## Description \n",
    "I want to aggregate observations of _Caladenia_ orchids in the ACT so I can analyse the relationship between records and the protection status and vegetation cover of the locations of each species.\n",
    "## Case Breakdown \n",
    "- **Actors:** Plant researcher\n",
    "- **Goals:** Compare the abundance of wild orchid flowers based on habitat type and protection status\n",
    "- **Scope:** Regional, 30-year aggregated\n",
    "## Generalised case\n",
    "I want to combine a suite of spatial variables at different scales across multiple sites so I can analyse the factors correlated with a variable of interest.\n",
    "## Comparable cases\n",
    "- As a grains researcher, I want to aggregate spatial data for frost and other extreme weather events associated with chickpeas and wheat grown at Merredin and other sites in Western Australia, so I can analyse the effects of such events on different varieties at different stages and advise growers on the best choices.â€¯\n",
    "- I want to aggregate iMapPests data for the same pest across multiple sites and locations so I can analyse the relationship between population levels and environmental context at the time and over the previous month, including weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity - all xyt), lunar phase (t) and greenness (xyt - see https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/8542d90e-6e20-4ad8-b30d-0a171b61d3f5).\n",

Some species are intermediate and a couple have coordinates indicating affinity with non-vegetated areas - these seem to be species particularly often recorded in suburban settings by citizen scientists."
