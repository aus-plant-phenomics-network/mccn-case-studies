    "# Case Study 3 - Select optimal survey locality\n",
    "## Description \n",
    "As a researcher, I want the ability to design a study/field campaign in advance, so that the best results can be obtained from that study/campaign.â€¯\n",
    "## Case Breakdown \n",
    "- **Actors:** Researcher\n",
    "- **Goals:** Design a campaign based on maximising variation between study sites\n",
    "- **Scope:** Regional, plot-based\n",
    "## Generalised case\n",
    "I want to analyse a suite of spatial variables for a set of candidate locations so I can find a subset that maximises the spread across environments.\n",
    "## Comparable cases\n",
    "- I want to combine a suite of environmental variables, including weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity - all xyt), lunar phase (t) and greenness (xyt - see https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/8542d90e-6e20-4ad8-b30d-0a171b61d3f5) and soils (pH, N, K, structure) for N (e.g. 50) candidate sites and then select the five sites that maximise spread across different environmental conditions.\n",
    "- I have a set of study sites in an area and wish to know the best location for adding one more, based on ensuring that the new site adds as much as possible to the range of environments studied.\n",

    "## Data Sources\n",
    "The primary goal for this case study is to demonstrate being able to import a set of environmental values for different sites and then use these to identify a subset that maximises spread across the various environmental dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple implementation that uses five environmental attributes imported for all Australia (or a subset like NSW) at a moderate grid scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Soil water pH (0-5cm) - see https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/ProductDetails-SoilAttributes.html\n",
    "2. Soil organic carbon (0-5cm) - see https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/ProductDetails-SoilAttributes.html\n",
    "3. Annual mean rainfall\n",
    "4. Annual maximum temperature\n",
    "5. Annual minimum temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- The first two can be imported directly as layers from SLGA. The others are probably available online in suitable forms at a slightly better grid resolution and can also be imported directly.\n",
    "- An enhancement to this case study would be to start by importing annual layers (say for the last 5 or 10 years) for each of the weather variables and then generating the mean, maximum and minimum respectively for each pixel across the selected years. These computed results would then be the inputs to the main datacube.\n",
    "- Latitude and longitude can also be incorporated later as additional variables."

    "4. Treat these layer values as orthogonal axes in a 5-dimensional space. The environmental distance between any two points will be the fifth root of the product of these five numbers.\n",
    "5. Generate 10 new layers, each representing the environmental distance between every pixel and one of the 10 current points.\n",
    "6. Build a new layer that holds the smallest value for each pixel from these 10 layers - that is the environmental distance between that point and the environmentally closest of the 10 current points.\n",
    "7. Find which pixel has the highest value in this final layer - it represents the most environmentally distant point and the one that should next be surveyed."
