    "## Case Breakdown \n",
    "- **Actors:** Researcher\n",
    "- **Goals:** Design a campaign based on maximising variation between stusy sitrs\n",
    "- **Scope:** Regional, plot-based\n",
    "- **Language:** R\n",
    "- **Extra:** TBD\n",
    "## Generalised case\n",
    "I want to analyse a suite of spatial variables for a set of candidate locations so I can find a subset that maximises the spread across environments.\n",
    "## Comparable cases\n",
    "- I want to combine a suite of environmental variables, including weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity - all xyt), lunar phase (t) and greenness (xyt - see https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/8542d90e-6e20-4ad8-b30d-0a171b61d3f5) and soils (pH, N, K, structure) for N (e.g. 50) candidate sites and then select the five sites that maximise spread across different environmental conditions.\n",
    "- I have a set of study sites in an area and wish to know the best location for adding one more, based on ensuring that the new site adds as much as possible to the range of environments studied.\n",

    "The primary goal for this case study is to demonstrate being able to import a set of environmental values for different sites and then use these to identify a subset that maximises spread across the various environmental dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think we can keep this simple and include say 5 environmental attributes imported for all Australia (or a subset like NSW) at a moderate grid scale (this needs to be fine-tuned). Suggested datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Soil water pH (0-5cm) - see https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/ProductDetails-SoilAttributes.html\n",
    "2. Soil organic carbon (0-5cm) - see https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/ProductDetails-SoilAttributes.html\n",
    "3. Annual mean rainfall\n",
    "4. Annual maximum temperature\n",
    "5. Annual minimum temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two can probably be imported directly as layers from SLGA. The others are probably available online in suitable forms at a slightly better grid resolution and could be imported directly. A nice enhancement to this case study could be to start by importing annual layers (say for the last 5 or 10 years) for each of these and then generating the mean, maximum and minimum respectively for each pixel across the selected years and using that computed output as the import into the main datacube.\n",
