    "# Case Study 7 - Produce farm zone map\n",
    "## Description \n",
    "As a grower, I want to analyse my yield maps and farm data, so I can zone up my farm based on site variability. \n",
    "## Case Breakdown \n",
    "- **Actors:** Grower\n",
    "- **Goals:** Customized needs for Grower\n",
    "- **Scope** Local,Paddock-Scale\n",
    "## Generalised case\n",
    "I want to analyse a suite of spatial variables across a site so I can derive a classification of areas by similarity.\n",
    "## Comparable cases\n",
    "- I want to combine a suite of environmental variables, including weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity - all xyt), lunar phase (t) and greenness (xyt - see https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/8542d90e-6e20-4ad8-b30d-0a171b61d3f5) and soils (pH, N, K, structure) for N (e.g. 50) candidate sites and then select derive a classification for each subunit based on a clustering algorithm.\n",

    "This notebook can be delivered as a tool into which the user can load their own data in the form of spreadsheets containing points and associated values for the variables to take into account in the analysis. The requirement is either for comprehensive (raster) coverage for the area or of a set of point-based measurements for each variable (in which case a simple kriging or mesh interpolation will be applied)."
