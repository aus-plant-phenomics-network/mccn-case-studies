# Multi-scalar Crop Characterisation Network (MCCN)

## Purpose
Supporting the agricultural sector to understand crop-environment relationships.

## The Challenge
Climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events, affecting the agricultural sector. Farmers face challenges in managing practices and selecting optimal crop breeds. Diverse data sources complicate understanding crop-environment relationships.

## The Response
Standardising access to Australiaâ€™s crop research data. Developing a framework and tools for sharing data according to FAIR principles. Enabling researchers to compare data on crop growth, performance, and environmental factors. This model can be expanded to the entire agricultural sector.
